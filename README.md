# Machine Learning Algorithms Built From Scratch
**Project Description:**
This project features the implementation of many Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch using only numpy and matplotlib libraries. 
It covers rigorous mathematical concepts like forward propagation, gradient descent, loss function and regularization.

Here are some of the Machine Learning Algorithms that will be covered:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear Regression
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. and more
